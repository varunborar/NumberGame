# NumberGame
This is a simple number guessing game made in python. 
Intially, on each level a random number is selected, user is given a range in which the number exists and is asked to guess the number. Each level only allows limited number
of guess, if the number guessed by user is wrong he is given a more precise range. After the user has exhausted all his guess the game ends. Otherwise if the user guesses the 
number right he is awarded with points and asked if he wants to continue the game to next level.
